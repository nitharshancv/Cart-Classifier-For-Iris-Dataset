Project Title: Iris Flower Classification with Decision Trees and Hyperparameter Optimization

Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to classify iris flowers into different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) using the famous Iris dataset. 
The project utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier and employs hyperparameter optimization through Grid Search to improve model performance.

Project Workflow:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: The project starts by loading the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris flowers, along with their corresponding species labels.
The dataset is split into a training set and a testing set to evaluate the model's performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search: Hyperparameter optimization is a critical step in improving the performance of machine learning models. 
In this project, we use Grid Search, a technique that systematically explores different combinations of hyperparameters to find the best set. We consider various hyperparameters for the Decision Tree Classifier, including the criterion for splitting, maximum depth of the tree, minimum samples required to split an internal node, and minimum samples required for a leaf node. Grid Search helps identify the hyperparameters that yield the best results for our specific problem.

Model Training and Evaluation: With the best hyperparameters determined by Grid Search, a new Decision Tree Classifier is created and trained on the training data.
The model learns patterns and relationships in the feature data to make predictions on the test data. After making predictions, we calculate the accuracy of the model by comparing its predictions to the actual labels in the test set.

Results: The project provides a summary of the best hyperparameters discovered during the Grid Search process, offering insight into the optimal configuration of the Decision Tree Classifier for this particular dataset.
Additionally, it reports the final accuracy of the model on the test data, indicating how well the model can classify iris flowers into their respective species.

Conclusion:
This project showcases the use of hyperparameter optimization with Grid Search to fine-tune a Decision Tree Classifier for the Iris flower classification task.
By systematically exploring different hyperparameter combinations, we ensure that the model achieves the highest possible accuracy.
The final model can be used to classify iris flowers accurately, making it a valuable tool for botanical research and species identification.
